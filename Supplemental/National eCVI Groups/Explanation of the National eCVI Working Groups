**eCVI Data Standards Workgroup**

The eCVI Data Standards Workgroup was originally formed by recommendation of the AAVLD/USAHA Committee on Animal Health Surveillance and Information Systems (CAHSIS) in 2012. This workgroup was originally named the Data Standards Subcommittee. In 2020, the subcommittee was renamed the Information Technology Standards Subcommittee after a need for a different set of data standards to be written for continuity of business (COB) permitting for emergency response was identified. The work previously performed by the Data Standards Subcommittee is now performed by a workgroup under the Information Technology Standards Subcommittee. An additional separate workgroup was initiated at this point, also serving under the Information Technology Standards Subcommittee, to begin writing data standards for COB permitting.

Purpose: To develop, maintain, and update the published eCVI XML schema used by eCVI provider applications in the United States. This schema defines the format and content of data exchanged between eCVI applications and databases.

Membership: State and federal animal health officials, animal health database representatives, eCVI provider representatives

**eCVI Standards Subcommittee**

The eCVI Standards Subcommittee was formed under the Traceability and Technology Committee of the National Assembly of State Animal Health Officials (NASAHO) in 2018.

Purpose: To develop, maintain, and update eCVI standards for eCVI provider applications in the United Sates and to review the eCVI and accompanying XML data files produced from each eCVI provider application to confirm the documents produced are consistent with the approved standards. These standards ensure compliance with data exchange requirements of the eCVI Data Standards Workgroup and include requirements for content, process, and presentation necessary to produce legally valid eCVIs. The original eCVI standards were developed and approved by NASAHO in April 2019 with a plan to re-evaluate and re-approve standards every two years.

Membership: State animal health officials
